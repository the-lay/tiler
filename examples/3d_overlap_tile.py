# 3D grayscale overlap-tile strategy tiling/merging example
#
# "This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy.
# To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring
# the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images,
# since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory." - Ronneberger et al 2015, U-Net paper
