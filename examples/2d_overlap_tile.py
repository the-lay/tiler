# 2D RGB overlap-tile strategy tiling/merging example
#
# "This strategy allows the seamless segmentation of arbitrarily large images by an overlap-tile strategy.
# To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring
# the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images,
# since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the GPU memory." - Ronneberger et al 2015, U-Net paper

# Overlap tile strategy assumes we only use the small, non-overlapping, middle part of a tile.
# Assuming we want to use centre 64x64 square, we should specify
# The overlap should be 0.5, 64 or explicitly (64, 64, 0)

# >>> window[32:-32, 32:-32, :] = 1
# >>> merger = Merger(tiler=tiler, window=window)
# or you can use window="overlap-tile"
# it will automatically calculate such window based on tiler.overlap and applied padding
